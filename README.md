**Traffic Sign Recognition Using Deep Learning** <br>
This project is a web-based application that identifies and classifies traffic signs from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. It is built with TensorFlow/Keras and Flask to provide a user-friendly interface for image upload and sign prediction. This system can recognize a variety of traffic signs, aiding drivers and autonomous systems by providing real-time sign classification.<br><br>
**Project Overview**<br>
Traffic Sign Recognition is a crucial part of autonomous driving systems. This project leverages deep learning techniques to build a robust traffic sign classification model. The model is trained on a dataset of traffic signs, and users can upload images of signs through a web interface. The application processes the image, predicts the traffic sign, and returns the result to the user.<br><br>
**Features**<br>
*Upload and Predict*: Upload a traffic sign image, and the model will predict the class of the sign.<br>
*Preprocessing*: Images are automatically preprocessed (grayscale conversion, histogram equalization) for optimal predictions.<br>
*Real-Time Results*: Immediate feedback and classification for uploaded images.<br>
*Web Interface*: Easy-to-use interface for uploading images and viewing results.<br>
